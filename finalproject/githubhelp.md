# Final Project – Python Collaboration Guide

This repository is for our class Python final project.
To prevent people from overwriting each other's work, we will use **branches and commits**.

---

# Repository Structure

```
finalproject/
    main.py
    edward.py
    phillipo.py
```

Each contributor should work in **their own file or branch** unless we agree otherwise.

---

# Basic Collaboration Rules

1. **Do NOT edit the main branch directly.**
2. Always create a **branch** first.
3. Make small commits with clear messages.
4. When finished, create a **Pull Request** so changes can be reviewed.

---

# Step 1 – Create a Branch

Click the branch selector near the top of the repository and create a branch.

Example branch names:

```
edward-work
phillipo-feature
sarah-input-validation
```

Branch names should describe what you are working on.

---

# Step 2 – Edit or Add Files

Inside your branch you can:

• Create a new file
• Edit an existing file
• Add functions or code

Example:

```
finalproject/phillipo.py
```

---

# Step 3 – Commit Changes

When saving changes:

Write a **clear commit message**.

Examples:

```
added function for user input
fixed loop error in main.py
created player class
```

Avoid messages like:

```
update
stuff
changes
```

---

# Step 4 – Create a Pull Request

When your work is ready:

1. Click **Pull Requests**
2. Click **New Pull Request**
3. Select your branch
4. Submit the request

This allows the team to review changes before merging.

---

# Commit Message Tips

Good commit messages:

```
Add dice rolling function
Fix indentation error
Create character stats dictionary
```

Bad commit messages:

```
stuff
fix
update
```

---

# Python Style Suggestions

Try to keep code readable.

Example:

```python
def roll_dice():
    import random
    return random.randint(1, 6)
```

Use meaningful variable names and comments where needed.

---

# Team Goal

The goal is to collaborate without breaking each other's work while building a working Python project together.

Small commits and clear communication help make this possible.
